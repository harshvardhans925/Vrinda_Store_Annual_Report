# Vrinda_Store_Annual_Report

# Objective
Vrinda Store aims to create a comprehensive annual sales report for 2022. This report will help the store understand customer demographics and purchasing behaviors, enabling them to strategize effectively to boost sales in the coming years.

# Steps Taken
***Data Collection**
Gather all sales data for 2022, including transaction dates, product details, sales amounts, quantities sold, customer demographics (age, gender), and sales channels (e.g., Amazon, Flipkart, Myntra).
***Data Cleaning**
Remove duplicate entries and handle any missing or inconsistent data to ensure accuracy.
Standardize data formats for consistency.
***Data Preparation**
Organize the cleaned data into a structured table.
Create additional columns if needed, such as total sales per transaction or categorizing products into different segments.
***Creating Pivot Tables**
Use pivot tables to summarize the data. For example, create pivot tables to show total sales by product, region, month, gender, age group, and sales channel.
These pivot tables will serve as the foundation for the dashboard.
***Designing the Dashboard**
Insert various charts (e.g., bar charts, line charts, pie charts) to visualize key metrics such as monthly sales trends, top-selling products, and regional performance.
Add slicers and timelines to make the dashboard interactive, allowing users to filter the data by different criteria (e.g., by month, product category, region, gender, age group, or sales channel).
***Formatting and Styling**
Apply consistent formatting to ensure the dashboard is visually appealing and easy to read.
Use conditional formatting to highlight important data points, such as highest sales or significant drops in sales.
